    <section>
        <p>
            Anna Lenik ("we") has developed our products and services.
            This privacy policy explains how we collect, use and share data through our products and services and we
            refer to these together as the "Apps".
        </p>
        <p>
            We reserve the right to and may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make any material
            changes, we will notify you through the Apps, or by presenting you with a new version of this Privacy Policy
            for you to accept, if we, for example, add new processing activities or collect some additional Personal
            Data from you. Please also periodically check back for updates. You can see the last updated date for this
            Privacy Policy at the bottom of the policy.
        </p>
        <p>
            We provide you with this Privacy Policy to make our users aware of the steps we take to ensure the security
            of their data when utilizing the Apps. This policy describes the types of information we collect when you
            use the Apps, how we use and protect that information, how long we retain it, and with whom we share it. It
            also explains what your rights and options are as they pertain to privacy. By using the Apps, you consent to
            our collection and use of your information as described in this Privacy Policy.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Your personal data</h2>
        <p>
            When you use our Apps, you may, in the process, give us data directly, from third parties, or through the
            Apps themselves (including through your interaction with the Apps) and we collect these data.
        </p>
        <p>These data are, for example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Usage activity about how you interact with us such as purchase history, what content you viewed, and
                which areas of our Apps you visited.
            </li>
            <li>Information about your mobile device such as model operating system, identifier and similar
                information
            </li>
            <li>Other information that helps us in providing and servicing the Apps.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            If you contact our customer support, then we may also receive information from you as part of that contact.
            Oftentimes this is your name, email and information about your device.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you utilize one of the Apps, our server automatically records certain information, which is sent by
            your mobile device and stored in log files. This includes your unique mobile device identifier and similar
            data. We use this information for statistical and other internal business purposes.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>2. Ways that we process your data</h2>
        <p>
            To manage and develop our Apps, we need information from you, which includes personal information. The
            purposes of processing this personal data includes:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>enabling our support team to contact you regarding support requests</li>
            <li>sending you push internal notifications. If you do not want to receive these notifications, you can
                manage your preferences either through your device or Apps settings.
            </li>
            <li>analyzing, operating, maintaining and improving the Apps and marketing activities</li>
            <li>optimizing user experience</li>
            <li>adding new features and services to the Apps</li>
            <li>responding to your comments, questions and requests and providing customer service.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Analytics are important to help us manage, protect and provide the Apps by obtaining information about how
            our users interact with our application. For example, we will receive the length of time spent in a session
            within the Apps, aggregate, non-specific geographic data, and crash data. Some Apps have the ability to send
            bug reports to us, which include the user's email address and an optional description of the problem, along
            with some auto-generated technical information. These reports are strictly voluntary and are only sent when
            the user after reviewing them expressly grants permission. If you choose to send us this data, then we will
            use this information to ensure that the Apps continue to appeal to our users, as well as for auditing,
            research, and analysis in order to maintain, protect and improve the app; ensuring the technical functioning
            of the app, as well as developing new apps.
        </p>
        <p>
            We may combine your usage information with that of others in a way that does not identify you or any
            individual person and to use such anonymized and aggregate data for conducting analytical research,
            performance tracking and benchmarking.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>3. Your rights</h2>
        <p>
            You are able to modify, correct and update your Personal Data in the Apps account settings. If you want to
            erase it from our analytics tools please write us at aisingapp@gmail.com
        </p>
        <p>
            You have a right to access your Personal Data you insert into the Apps and ask us about what kind of
            Personal Data we have about you. You can do this by using the app settings or by writing to
            aisingapp@gmail.com.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you are a user located in Switzerland, the EU or the EEA, you have certain rights with respect to your
            personal information.
        </p>
        <ul>

            <li>Right to correct or update your personal data</li>
            <li>Right to restrict processing of your personal data</li>
            <li>Right to portability</li>
            <li>Right to withdraw consent if we have asked for it</li>
            <li>Right to file a complaint with a data protection authority</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            If you want to submit a request regarding your rights, please contact customer support at
            aisingapp@gmail.com.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please keep in mind that in case of a vague access, erasure, objection request or any other request in
            exercise of the mentioned rights we may engage the individual in a dialogue so as to better understand the
            motivation for the request and to locate responsive information. In case this is impossible, we reserve the
            right to refuse granting your request.
        </p>
        <p>
            Following the provisions of GDPR we might also require you to prove your identity (for example, by
            requesting an ID or any other proof of identity) in order for you to invoke the mentioned rights,
            specifically if you exercise them in respect to special categories of Personal Data like data about health.
            This is made to ensure that no rights of third parties are violated by your request, and the rights
            described in this section are exercised by an actual Personal Data subject or an authorized person.
        </p>

        <h2>Sharing your Personal Data and Information</h2>
        <p>
            We will share your Personal Data and information with third parties only in the ways that are described
            in this Privacy Policy.
        </p>
        <p>
            We may disclose your Personal Data:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process.</li>
            <li>when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your
                safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.
            </li>
            <li>if we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be
                notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of
                your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.
            </li>
            <li>to any other third party with your prior explicit consent to do so.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            We share the information we collect with third-party business partners who commit to comply with
            applicable laws concerning their usage of your Personal Data (for example, GDPR for the EU residents).
            Our third-party business partners may share your Personal Data with their own third-party business
            partners, granted they have appropriate data protection safeguards in place, and use the information
            either for themselves or on behalf of their own business partners to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Operate and improve their services;</li>
            <li>Provide you with advertisements and information for products and services in this app or on other
                apps or websites based on variables such as your location, and assess your level of engagement with
                them; and
            </li>
            <li>Carry out other purposes that are disclosed to you and to which you consent.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Depending on a service you use, we may share some of your Personal Data and information with third-party
            business partners who perform analytical and other tasks for us (in some jurisdictions such parties may
            qualify for being a ‘processor’ under applicable laws). These are the third-party services with whom,
            among others, we may share some of your Personal Data and information:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Amplitude</strong>: a third-party analytics service, to collect information about how users
                interact with our app. This helps us understand usage patterns, improve performance, and enhance
                user experience. Amplitude may collect information such as:
                <ul>
                    <li>Device type and operating system</li>
                    <li>App version and screen views</li>
                    <li>Feature usage and session duration</li>
                    <li>Crash reports and click/tap behavior</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Appwrite</strong>: We employ Appwrite as our primary persistence layer. All user‑generated
                summaries and transcriptions are securely stored on Appwrite’s infrastructure. These records are
                retained to enable users to access, review, and manage their content over time.
            </li>
            <li><strong>OpenAI</strong>: For natural‑language processing and transcription, we forward user inputs
                (text and audio) directly to the OpenAI API. We do not persist any data on OpenAI’s systems beyond
                the duration of the API call. No transcripts, summaries, or raw inputs are retained by OpenAI on our
                behalf.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Sentry</strong>: We utilize Sentry for error monitoring and diagnostic purposes. Sentry’s
                collection is limited strictly to technical metadata—specifically, device operating‑system version,
                device model, and comparable environment details. No personal identifiers or user content are
                transmitted to or stored by Sentry.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Our third-party partners are either EU-based or certified under the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework that
            ensures that European data protection requirements are met. The privacy policy of these services can be
            found on their respective websites. Be informed that some third-party service providers may have their
            servers located in the United States.
