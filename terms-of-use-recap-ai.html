    <h1>Terms of Use Recap AI</h1>

    <section>
        <h2>General</h2>
        <p>
            These Terms of Use govern, together with the Privacy Policy, your use of the mobile applications (the “Application”) and related services provided by Anna Lenik (“Us”, “We”).
        </p>
        <p>
            By downloading the Application you agree to be bound by these Terms of Use and by continuing using, you confirm and affirm that you have read, understood and agree to these Terms of Use.
            If you do not agree to these Terms of Use, do not use the Application.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Disclaimer of Warranty</h2>
        <p>
            The Application and all of its content is provided on an “As Is” and “As available” basis and We do not provide any assurances of the availability or usability by you of the Application.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>
            We shall not be liable for any errors in any content or for any actions taken in reliance thereon. Furthermore, we shall not be liable to you for any interception of online communications, software or hardware problems (including, without limitation, viruses, loss of data or compatibility conflicts).
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Subscription</h2>
        <p>Our apps have an optional Premium subscription:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Recap AI Transcribe Pro ($5.99 weekly)</li>
            <li>Recap AI Transcript Monthly ($24.99 monthly)</li>
            <li>Recap AI Transcribe Audio Yearly ($99.99 yearly)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The purchase will be charged to your iTunes account. Once you're a subscriber, you can manage your subscription from iTunes or on your iOS unit after purchasing it, and you'll also be able to cancel the auto-renewing subscription from there.
            Deleting the app does not cancel the subscription. You can, however, cancel a subscription even after you've deleted the app.
        </p>
        <p>
            The subscription will auto-renew 24 hours before the subscription period ends, with the same kind of subscription you already bought, to the same price.
        </p>
        <p>
            You may at any time terminate your membership, in which case your membership will still be valid for the subscription time you have already paid for. Our auto-renewable In-app purchase subscriptions can only be cancelled using the App Store cancellation service.
            If you would like to contact Apple, please use this link:

        </p>
        <p>
            Subscription fees can be found in the mobile applications. We reserve the right to change the subscription fees from time to time.
